1. Create a public/private key pair.
2.  The public key should be shared (i.e. stored on the sandbox servers).
It should be used to encrypt communication from the servers to me. 
The public key has a mathematial relationship with the private key, such that communication
encrypted with the public key can be decrypted using the private key, but it
is computationally impractical to decrypt the communication (or determine the private key
from the public key.
3. The private key should be stored securely on my personal machine as it is as or more sensitive
than a password.  It will be used to decrypt communication from the sandbox servers.
